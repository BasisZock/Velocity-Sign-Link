# Velocity Sign Link

A lightweight Paper/Spigot plugin for Velocity that allows players to use signs to connect to other servers.

## Features

- **Save Signs:** Use `/savesign <serverName>` to configure a sign with its target server.
- **Retrieve Sign Data:** Use `/getsign` to read a sign's data.
- **Delete Sign Data:** Use `/deletesign` to remove the configuration from a sign.
- **Cooldown Management:** Use `/signcooldown <milliseconds>` to set a global cooldown for sign usage.
- **Customizable Cooldown Display:** Option in `config.yml` (`display_below_one_second_as_one`) to show cooldowns less than 1 second as "1 second".
- **Conditional "No Data Found" Message:** Control the visibility of the "No Data found for this sign" message using the `VeloSign.nomessage` permission.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes SQLite to store sign data.
- **Velocity/BungeeCord Integration:** Leverages plugin messaging to send players between servers.
